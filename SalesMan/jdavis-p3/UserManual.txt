In order to use this program load up thePresets.txt and theCities.txt with your data. 

thePresets.txt takes data in this order:
[Individual tours per generation]
[how many generations to run]
[percentage of mutations]
[percentage of elites]
[number of cities to run]

theCities takes 380 doubles that correspond to the distances between the cities.

if there is no executable simply run make while in the program directory. Then run the executable and the output will be piped to stdout.
