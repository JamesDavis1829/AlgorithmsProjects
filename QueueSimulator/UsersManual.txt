This program requires that there be a text file called "runSimulation.txt" in the same directory as the program
This file must be formatted as follows:
NumberForLambda
NumberForMu
NumberForM
NumberForN

for example the file:
2
3
2
5000
would run the simulation for lambda = 2, mu = 3, M = 2, and n = 5000. In order to run the simulation just run the file called
simulation provided it is in the same directory as the specified text file. If the program simulation does not exist run make 
and it will be creted using the source files.

Known Issues:
-The values of experimental P0 and experimental Wq are incorrect.
	This bug has been explored in the following ways:
	Checking the sorting of the heap
	Rewriting the heap sorting algorithms
	Checking the time functions to make sure that they returning the correct average value
	Checking for alternate Ms,ns, mus,and lambdas
	Checking to make sure the process statement is in the correct order
	Checking the amout of people processed through the simulation
	Checking to see that all of the people processed are not garbage values
	It appears to be an issue with how many people are processed as departures and arrivals in a row however the cause of this issue it not known
